# Lazen
The Lazen Programming Language

<h2>Why ?</h2>

 Lazen is made to be an interpreted open-source, object-oriented, efficient, simple, dynamically-typed and duck-typed             programming language.
<br><br>

Way many programming languages were created in the past, and everyday, a new programming language is created. I've personally used many good programming languages in my programming life. Lazen is modest. It will not try to be "original" or to invent some completly new programming concepts and/or paradigms. It is made for being one of the simplest and "universal" programming language. It is made for programmers who want to code what they think, it is made for programmers who want to spend more time on thinking about the final render of their software/code than on trying to fix syntaxic bugs/trying to understand syntax and/or looking for help on forums. Yes, with some advanced knowledge you should have less syntaxic/compilation errors. But why not having less errors right now ? Without needing any advanced programming knowledge ? Lazen is made for that. When you're programming with Lazen, you think about your software itself less than his source code.
<br><br>

Python, as an example, was the best programming language I have used before Lazen. Lazen is inspired by Python's and C#'s languages syntaxes. It has some "improvements" and "optimisations" on his syntax. The syntax of many languages that inspired Lazen are pretty good, tiny, efficient, easy and fast to learn, read and understand. 
<br><br>
Unlike many other programming languages, Lazen is automatically elegant. You should not have to worry about making some stupid code. With Lazen, even if you're writing bad code, it will still elegant. Because there are not many ways to make what you did in Lazen. Lazen is simple, it has not much solutions for every idea, but every solutions it offers are simple, fast and efficient.

</h2>Many reasons Why you should start learning the Lazen programming language today.</h2>

1) It's interpreted, wrote via an interpreted language, but it's fast.

2) It's all open-source and made from A to Z, without using any programming-language creation tool. 
You can see by yourself the parsing-tree or the bytecode compilation of your own source code using a flag on console-mode !

3) It's non-competitive, although it tries to be fast, it is non-competitive and it will never be competitive. It means it doesn't tries to surpass other programming language's performances. It just tries to be equal to other programming language's performances, it stills tries to reach the highest efficiencity and performances possible for a programming language. The principal goal of Lazen is to share knowledge and programming-pleasure with programmers and programming newbies.

4) It's long-living and it's often updated. Yes Lazen is often updated because it's made with pure programming and compilers/interpreters theory passion. Also, read the 5th reason.

5) Anyone can contribute ! Lazen is not on github for no reason, it's there because I want people to contribute to this project. Don't hesitate, if you have any change to make about Lazen, just follow the steps <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312">here</a>.
