# Lazen
The Lazen Programming Language

<h2>Why ?</h2>

 Lazen is made to be an interpreted open-source, object-oriented, efficient, simple, dynamically-typed and duck-typed             programming language.
<br><br>

Way many programming languages were created in the past, and everyday, a new programming language is created. I've personally used many good programming languages in my programming life. 
<br><br>

Python, as an example, was the best programming language I have used before Lazen. Lazen is inspired by Python's and C#'s languages syntaxes. It has some "improvements" and "optimisations" on his syntax. The syntax of many languages that inspired Lazen are pretty good, tiny, efficient, easy and fast to learn, read and understand.
<br><br>

1) It's interpreted, wrote via an interpreted language, but it's fast.

2) It's all open-source and made from A to Z, without using any programming-language creation tool. 
You can see by yourself the parsing-tree or the bytecode compilation of your own source code using a flag on console-mode !

3) It's non-competitive, although it tries to be fast, it is non-competitive and it will never be competitive. It means it doesn't tries to surpass other programming language's performances. It just tries to be equal and to have high-performances. The principal goal of Lazen is to share knowledge and programming-pleasure with programmers/programming newbies.

4) It's long-living and it's often updated. Yes Lazen is often updated because it's made with passion, I love programming, so Lazen is purely relaxing to improve. Read the 5th reason.

5) Anyone can contribute ! Lazen is not on github for no reason, it's there because I want people to contribute to this project. Don't hesitate, if you have any change to make about Lazen, just follow the steps <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312">there</a>.
